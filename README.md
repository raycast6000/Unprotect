# Unprotect
A tool that freezes Roblox and makes all its pages available. This is useful for debugging and running banned tools such as x64dbg, Cheat Engine, or Scylla.

## Usage
Make sure Roblox is open before you do this and just run the tool. A "Ready?" message will be prompted, to continue just press any key. \
**Keep in mind that once you run this tool Roblox will be unrecoverable, meaning that it cannot be reverted to its original state.**
